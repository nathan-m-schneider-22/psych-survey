The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would ordinarily experience from viewing a computer monitor and using a mouse or keyboard for a similar amount of time.</h4> <h4>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or you may choose to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your participation in this study will remain confidential. No personally identifiable information will be associated with your data. Also, all analyses of the data will be averaged across all the participants, so your individual responses will never be specifically analyzed. </h4> <h4>Agreement: The nature and purpose of this research have been sufficiently explained and I agree to participate in this study.
